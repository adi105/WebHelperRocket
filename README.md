# WebHelper Rocket
**Authors: Adrian Bernat and Edward Koroteev**

WebHelper Rocket is a functional web application created using Rust's Rocket framework.
Taking inspiration from mobile helper programs, such as Siri and Alexa, WebHelper takes
in input from a text field and, based upon that input, can perform a variety of tasks.
Tasks to be implemented:
* Web scraper
* Calculator
  * The idea is to make it an integer calculator that accepts a string, i.e. "52+47*3",
    and spits out the correct answer. This is **finished** and supports parenthesis.
* Weather
* Google search (Using an API to fetch the first link)
* Dictionary API for definitions
* Craigslist Web Scraper
* Easter Eggs!
* (More ideas pending!)
