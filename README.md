# WebHelper Rocket
WebHelper Rocket is a functional web application created using Rust's Rocket framework.
Taking inspiration from mobile helper programs, such as Siri and Alexa, WebHelper takes
in input from a text field and, based upon that input, can perform a variety of tasks.
Tasks to be implemented:
* Web scraper
* Calculator
  * The idea is to make it an integer calculator that accepts a string, i.e. "52+47*3",
    and spits out the correct answer. Need to look into API for char-to-int, string-to-int,
    etc.
* Weather
* Google search (Using an API to fetch the first link)
* Easter Eggs!
* (More ideas pending!)
